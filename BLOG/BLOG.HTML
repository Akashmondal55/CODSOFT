            <h3>NATIONALIST</h3>
            <p>The works of Rabindranath Tagore consist of poems, novels, short stories, dramas, paintings, drawings, 
                and music that Bengali poet and Brahmo philosopher Rabindranath Tagore created over his lifetime.
                Tagore's literary reputation is disproportionately influenced by regard for his poetry; however, 
                he also wrote novels, essays, short stories, travelogues, dramas, and thousands of songs. Of 
                Tagore's prose, his short stories are perhaps most highly regarded; indeed, he is credited with
                 originating the Bengali-language version of the genre. His works are frequently noted for their
                  rhythmic, optimistic, and lyrical nature. However, such stories mostly borrow from deceptively
                   simple subject matter — the lives of ordinary people and children..</p>

                    <P>Tagore’s work in general is imbued with sadness. His mother passed away when he was a boy, 
                        and his life was marked by continued personal tragedy. He was plagued with grief after the
                         suicide of his childhood playmate, sister-in-law and literary companion, Kadambari Devi, 
                         and the years between 1902 and 1907, saw the deaths of his wife, daughter and youngest son.

                         Some examples are Aaguner Poroshmoni, Klanti Amar Khoma Koro Probhu, Bipode More Rokkha Koro and Aanondoloke Mongolaloke.

                        played a crucial role in instilling a sense of nationalistic

                    <P>The poet begins with these words to see the idealized vision of his home country. 
                        He said no one in his country should ever live in constant Fear. Instead, they should 
                        be bold and confident in themselves. Knowledge should be available to all citizens.</P>
